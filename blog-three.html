    <h2>What is Web frameworks</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>web framework (WF)</strong> or <strong>web application framework (WAF)</strong> is a software framework that is
         designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, 
         and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on 
         the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common 
         activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries 
         for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote 
         code reuse.Although they often target development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable to static websites.  
    </p>
    <h3>Types of framework architectures</h3>
    <P>
      Most web frameworks are based on the model view controller (MVC) pattern.
    </p>
    <h3>Model view controller (MVC)</h3>
    <p>
      Many frameworks follow the MVC architectural pattern to separate the data model into business 
      rules (the "controller") and the user interface (the "view"). This is generally considered a good 
      practice as it modularizes code, promotes code reuse, and allows multiple interfaces to be 
      applied. In web applications, this permits different views to be presented, for example serving 
      different web pages for mobile vs. desktop browsers, or providing machine-readable web service interfaces.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Push-based vs. pull-based</h3>
    <p>Most MVC frameworks follow a push-based architecture also called "action-based". 
      These frameworks use actions that do the required processing, and then "push" the data to the view 
      layer to render the results.An alternative to this is pull-based architecture, sometimes also 
      called "component-based". These frameworks start with the view layer, which can then "pull" 
      results from multiple controllers as needed. In this architecture, multiple controllers can be 
      involved with a single view.</p>
    
    <h3>Three-tier organization</h3>
      <p>In three-tier organization, applications are structured around three physical tiers: client, 
        application, and database.The database is normally an RDBMS. The application 
        contains the business logic, running on a server and communicates with the client using 
        HTTP.The client on web applications is a web browser that runs HTML generated by the 
        application layer.The term should not be confused with MVC, where, unlike in three-tier 
        architecture, it is considered a good practice to keep business logic away from the controller, the 
        "middle layer"</p>

      <h3>Framework applications</h3>
        <p>Frameworks are built to support the construction of internet applications based on a single programming language, ranging in focus from general purpose tools such as Zend Framework and Ruby on Rails, which augment the capabilities of a specific language, to native-language programmable packages built around a specific user application, such as content management systems (CMS), some mobile development tools and some portal tools.</p>
      <h3>General-purpose website frameworks</h3>
        <p>Web frameworks must function according to the architectural rules of browsers and protocols such as HTTP, which is stateless. Webpages are served up by a server and can then be modified by the browser using JavaScript. Either approach has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
        <p>Server-side page changes typically require that the page be refreshed, but allow any language to be used and more computing power to be utilized. Client-side changes allow the page to be updated in small chunks which feels like a desktop application, but are limited to JavaScript and run in the user's browser, which may have limited computing power. Some mix of the two is typically used.[16] Applications which make heavy use of JavaScript and only refresh parts of the page, are called single-page applications and typically make use of a client-side JavaScript web framework to organize the code.</p> 
      <h3>Server-side</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Apache Wicket</li>
          <li>ASP.NET Core</li>
          <li>Cake PHP</li>
          <li>Catalyst</li>
          <li>CodeIgniter</li>
          <li>Cpp CMS</li>
          <li>Django</li>
          <li>Express.js</li>
          <li>Flask</li>
          <li>Grails</li>
          <li>Jam.py</li>
          <li>Laravel</li>
          <li>Mojolicious</li>
          <li>Pop PHP Framework</li>
          <li>Phoenix</li>
          <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
          <li>Sails.js</li>
          <li>Symfony</li>
          <li>Spring MVC</li>
          <li>WT (web toolkit)</li>
          <li>Yii</li>
          <li>Zend Framework</li>
        </ul> 
    <h3>Client-side</h3>
        <p>Examples include Backbone.js, AngularJS, Angular, Ember.js, ReactJS, jQuery UI, Svelte, and Vue.js.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Frameworks typically set the control flow of a program and allow the user of the framework to "hook into" that flow by exposing various events.[18] This "inversion of control" design pattern is considered to be a defining principle of a framework, and benefits the code by enforcing a common flow for a team which everyone can customize in similar ways.[18] For example, some popular "microframeworks" such as Ruby's Sinatra (which inspired Express.js) allow for "middleware" hooks prior to and after HTTP requests. These middleware functions can be anything, and allow the user to define logging, authentication and session management, and redirecting.</p>
      <p>
        By doing a lot of practice, you will definitely experience errors and
        bugs in your code, but don't worry, you will overcome them all!
